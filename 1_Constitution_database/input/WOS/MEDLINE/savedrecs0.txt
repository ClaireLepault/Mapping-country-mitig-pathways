Wang, Chun-Chun; Wang, Yuan; Zhu, Xiao-Dong		Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology	30	10	3535-3543	2019	2019 Oct	Chinese	1	5	为了应对全球气候变暖,中国政府提出到2030年CO2排放达到峰值(或峰值平台)的减排目标.为了探究中国能否实现该减排目标,本研究以江苏省为例,基于长期能源规划替代模型(LEAP),耦合对数平均迪氏分解模型,运用情景分析法科学设定快速、中速、慢速达峰3种发展情景,预测CO2排放达峰时间及峰值水平.结果表明: 20002015年间,经济规模效应是CO2排放总量增长的主要驱动因素,其贡献度高达147.4%;技术进步效应是最重要的缓解因素,贡献度为-60.4%,一次能源结构效应、产业结构效应、人均收入效应、人口规模效应的贡献度分别为-5.3%、9.7%、11.0%、0.6%.在快速、中速达峰情景下,江苏省分别在2025和2029年达到CO2排放峰值,峰值分别为7.01、7.95亿t,慢速达峰情景下未能实现2030年的CO2排放达峰目标.综合研究分析,江苏省有着较大的减排潜力,经过相应的努力能够实现CO2减排目标.为实现2030年的CO2减排目标可采取以下措施:主动适应经济新常态,稳定发展增速;积极发展第三产业,平衡经济结构;持续推进节能减排技术,降低能源消费强度;大力发展天然气及核电等清洁能源,优化一次能源消费结构.

J	12344780	Journal Article	All the coal in China.		Lenssen, N		World watch	6	2	22-9	1993	1993 	English	0	7	China is emerging as a serious producer of carbon emissions from its burning of coal. China contributes 11% of global carbon emissions, which is still less than its population share. Economic reforms are likely to boost emissions. 33% of all fuel burned in China produces useful energy compared to 50-60% in the USA and Japan. Low prices encourage wasteful use. The Chinese government responds to energy shortages by investing scarce capital in building more mines, power plants, and oil wells. It is unlikely that investing in expanding conventional energy supplies will be a viable solution, regardless of the availability of capital to invest, because air pollution threatens life. Particulate suspension is 14 times greater in China than in the USA. 14% of the country is affected by acid rain. Global warming may be affecting the northern drought prone areas. The solutions must involve greater efficiency. Industrial consumption of energy is more than 66% of energy produced. Energy use for a typical steel or cement factory is 7-75% greater per ton than Western countries, i.e., 55-60% efficiency versus 80% in Europe. The inefficiency is due to poor maintenance and operating procedures and old or obsolete technology. The savings in building a compact, fluorescent light bulb factory is compared to the cost of building coal-fired power plants and transmission facilities. Conservation of heat in northern buildings could be accomplished with boiler improvements, insulation, and double- glazed windows. A $3 billion/year investment could yield a cut in energy demand by nearly 50%. The carbon emissions would be reduced from 1.4 billion tons to 1 billion tons in 2025. Between 1980 and 1985 the energy efficiency program was able to reduce growth in energy from 7% to 4% without slowing growth in industrial production. Since 1985, the government has directed expenditures toward expanding the energy supply, which reduced efficiency expenditures from 10% to 6% of total investment. Alternatives are natural gas or solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy. Alternatives are natural gas or solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy. International lending agencies must now shift their support to renewable resource development and efficiency improvement and education; an example from industrialized countries would also be very persuasive.
